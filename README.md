### What is this repository for? ###

EWALD is an open-source software that implements 3 optical diffraction tomography reconstruction algorithms, all based on Fourier Diffraction Theorem (FDT): (1) DI (Direct Inversion), GP (Gerchberg-Papoulis algorithm) and GPSC (Gerchberg-Papoulis with total-variation-based object-support constraint). It is dedicated for investigation of biological and technical samples, like cells, bacterias, optical fibers etc.

The scientific description of the GPSC method can be found in [1,2]:
