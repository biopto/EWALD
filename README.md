### What is this repository for? ###

GTVIC (Generalized Total Variation Iterative Contraint) is an image-processing algorithm for optical tomography. It is dedicated for investigation of biological samples, like cells, bacterias etc. The reconstruction method is based on the Fourier Diffraction Theorem (FDT) supported with a strong regularizer, calculated with Total Variation minimization. Also, a classic FDT-based reconstruction methods without regularization are implemented.

The scientific description of the GTVIC method can be found in [1]:
